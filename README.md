because of the following:

1. Minimize the chances of a user solving this CTF in a different way
2. Minimize the chances of a user missing hints by modifying or bypassing web pages/tokens.
3. Less traffic 
4. More reliability for users solving this CTF.


ubuntu 20.04 is recommended for the LPE part.
